# Project Requirements

To set up and configure your project, please follow these steps:

## 1. Create the `environment.ts` File

Create a file named `environment.ts` in the `/src/environment/` directory. You can use the provided `environment.example.ts` file as a template. Make sure to update the configuration values according to your needs.

Example structure of `/src/environment/environment.ts`:

```typescript
// /src/environment/environment.ts

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  firebase: {
    projectId: "<projectId>",
    appId: "<appId",
    storageBucket: "<storageBucket>",
    apiKey: "<apiKey>",
    authDomain: "<authDomain>",
    messagingSenderId: "<messagingSenderId>",
    measurementId: "<measurementId>",
  },
  application: {
    name: "application name",
    description: "application description",
  },
  // Add other configuration values as needed
};
```

## 2. Newsletter Template

If you wish to use the newsletter template, follow these additional steps:

### 2.1 Add Images

Place the required images for the newsletter template in the `/assets/image/` folder.

Example structure of `/assets/image/`:

/assets/image/logos

- newsletter_logo.jpg
- owner_logo.png
- Add other images as needed

/assets/image/content

- content1.jpg
- content2.png
- Add other images as needed

### 2.2 Integrate Newsletter Template

Integrate the newsletter template into your project according to your project structure and requirements.

**Note**: If you don't want to use the newsletter template, you can skip this section.

That's it! Your project should now be configured with the necessary files and settings.
